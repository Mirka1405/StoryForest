An idea by u/GoatsWithWigs: A DnD game without any dice

Gameplay: Once app is installed, you are taken to a screen with buttons:
"Join Random Forest"
"Create New Forest" (lvl 80 or more required)

When the new player joins a random forest, they are taken to a 1-on-1 chat with a fungus (high-level player) who chats with the new player, giving all important context and story settings

Meanwhile, the fungus is chatting with several players, new or high-level (does not matter), each in their own 1-on-1 chats.

Once the fungus declares their story complete, the entire chat is consolidated into a single superchat that any user can view on the homepage. Each player gets congratulated for being key pieces of this story, and the best player in each game is awarded XP points by the fungus.

Players who are the best players in enough games to reach lvl 80 will unlock the "Create New Forest" feature. They themselves are now a fungus.

Players, at any given point in the story, can do a vote to report a fungus for trolling or misdirection.
