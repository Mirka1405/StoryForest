# StoryForest
An idea by @beholdthecandle: A DnD game without any dice

## Gameplay
On the main menu, the player will see these buttons:
- "Join Random Forest"  
- "Create New Forest" (lvl 80 or more required)

### Players
Players can be one of the two types:
- Tree
- Fungi

Fungi shape the forest, interweaving the roots - destinies - of the trees. Since only experienced players are worthy of being a Fungus, a player may only become one after achieving a certain level. (80, for now)

When a new player joins a random forest, they are taken to a 1-on-1 chat with a Fungus who chats with the new player, giving all important context and story settings.

Meanwhile, the Fungus is chatting with several players, new or high-level (does not matter), each in their own 1-on-1 chats.

Once the Fungus declares their story complete, the entire chat is consolidated into a single superchat that any user can view on the homepage. Each player gets congratulated for being key pieces of this story, and the best player in each game is awarded XP points by the Fungus.

Players who have achieved level 80 will unlock the "Create New Forest" feature. They themselves are now a Fungus.

Trees, at any given point in the story, can vote to report a Fungus for trolling, lewd content, or misdirection. Because Fungi are experienced players, that issue is better dealt with by server admins rather than the bot.

Those things from players are not a threat to story forests since fungi can veto whatever breaks the rules. Still, they can kick players from their games at their own discretion, or kick and report if needed. Fungi who kick players are responsible for writing it off as the player's character dying or losing importance to the plot.


#### XP System:

Every player has an XP score that gains +1 points for every 16 characters sent in SF.
Any message sent less than 7s after another message is inelligible for the above condition (to prevent spamming abuse)
Each message that contains sexually explicit terms, slurs, and offensive language will **remove** 10 XP points from the player and delete itself.
Gore and blood are okay though! We just want to keep things PG-13, basically.

At the end of every SF, the fungus gets to rate each player with a value of 1-10 on several criteria:
- Flow (ability to move with the current and compromise if things don't go the player's way)
- Creativity (imagination and adaptability that the roleplayer brings to the table)
The player with the highest score out of 20 possible points gains a "Spore Bonus" which adds 500 XP to the player's total XP bar.

After the SF is archived, the story as well as the total number of XP earned by each player in the session is recorded.

Once a player reaches 5,000 XP points they gain a special role that unlocks the ability to create an SF and be its Fungus.
