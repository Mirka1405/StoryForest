# StoryForest
An idea by @beholdthecandle: A DnD game without any dice

## Gameplay
A player may use /join to join an existing game, or /createforest to become a Fungus and create a game.

### Players
Players can be one of the two types:
- Tree
- Fungi

Fungi shape the forest, interweaving the roots - destinies - of the trees. Since only experienced players are worthy of being a Fungus, a player may only become one after achieving a certain amount of XP.

When a new player joins a random forest, they are taken to a 1-on-1 chat with a Fungus who chats with the new player, giving all important context and story settings.

Meanwhile, the Fungus is chatting with several players, new or high-level (does not matter), each in their own 1-on-1 chats.

Once the Fungus declares their story complete, the entire chat is archived and all the threads are made public. Each player gets congratulated for being key pieces of this story, and the best player in each game is awarded XP points by the Fungus.

Trees, at any given point in the story, can vote to report a Fungus for trolling, lewd content, or misdirection. Because Fungi are experienced players, that issue is better dealt with by server admins rather than the bot.

Those things from players are not a threat to story forests since fungi can veto whatever breaks the rules. Still, they can kick players from their games at their own discretion, or kick and report if needed. Fungi who kick players are responsible for writing it off as the player's character dying or losing importance to the plot.


#### XP System:

Every player has an XP score that gains +1 points for every 16 characters sent in SF.
Any message sent less than 7s after another message is inelligible for the above condition (to prevent spamming abuse)
Each message that contains explicit terms, slurs, and offensive language can be reported by the Fungus. If the 
Gore and blood are okay though! We just want to keep things PG-13, basically.

At the end of every SF, the fungus gets to rate each player with a value of 1-10 on several criteria:
- Flow (ability to move with the current and compromise if things don't go the player's way)
- Creativity (imagination and adaptability that the roleplayer brings to the table)
Depending on the score 0-20, the player may receive anywhere from 0 to 100 bonus XP.

After the SF is archived, the story as well as the total number of XP earned by each player in the session is recorded.

Once a player reaches 500 XP (this can be changed by the server) points they gain the ability to create an SF and be its Fungus.
