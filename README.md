# StoryForest
An idea by u/GoatsWithWigs: A DnD game without any dice

## Gameplay
On the main menu, the player will see these buttons:
- "Join Random Forest"  
- "Create New Forest" (lvl 80 or more required)

### Players
Players can be one of the two types:
- Tree
- Fungi

Fungi shape the forest, interweaving the roots - destinies - of the trees. Since only experienced players are worthy of being a fungus, a player may only become one after achieving a certain level. (80, for now)

When a new player joins a random forest, they are taken to a 1-on-1 chat with a fungus who chats with the new player, giving all important context and story settings.

Meanwhile, the fungus is chatting with several players, new or high-level (does not matter), each in their own 1-on-1 chats.

Once the fungus declares their story complete, the entire chat is consolidated into a single superchat that any user can view on the homepage. Each player gets congratulated for being key pieces of this story, and the best player in each game is awarded XP points by the fungus.

Players who have achieved level 80 will unlock the "Create New Forest" feature. They themselves are now a fungus.

Trees, at any given point in the story, can vote to report a fungus for trolling, lewd content, or misdirection.
